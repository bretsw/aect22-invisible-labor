Working in education requires many skills and keeping up with rapid changes

--

necessitating ongoing professional development

Educators often have to figure things out on their own

through various means of informal learning

### Definitions:

--

- **Labor** is effort- or process-oriented understanding of professional activity.

--

- **Invisibility** is the processes through which professional activities might be overlooked, ignored, or devalued.

To understand educators' invisible labor, we searched 10 databases for:

--

- Peer-reviewed academic journal articles

--

- Written in English

--

- Years **2011–2021**

--

- **Keywords in Abstract:** and with at least one of the words education, teacher, educator, instructor, social media, professional development, professional learning, **or** informal learning

--

- **Keywords in Full Text:** invisible work, invisible labor, digital labor, hidden work, hidden labor, shadow work, shadow labor, shared economy, gift economy, invisible economy, **or** hidden economy

--

- A study about the relationship between faculty members’ increased administrative responsibilities and job stress

--

- These **administrative responsibilities** were invisible because they were **background labor**, overlooked because not part of the main responsibilities of research and teaching

```

--

- A study about how non-tenure-track faculty members perceive and operationalize their agency in a higher education research institution

--

- The faculty members' **non-tenure-track status** meant **precarious labor** intersecting with background labor
