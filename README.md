### Abstract

This paper investigates how researchers have studied educators’ professional activities in terms of invisible labor. We conducted a systematic literature review of academic journal articles spanning 2011–2021 following PRISMA standards. From 16 identified articles, we developed a model of educators’ invisible labor that includes categories of background, care, precarious, and identity labor as well as labor in a non-traditional sphere. We present these as five intersecting mechanisms of invisibility with applications for professional learning.
